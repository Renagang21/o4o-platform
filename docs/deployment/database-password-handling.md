# Database Password Handling Guide

## Overview

This guide addresses the common "password must be a string" error that can occur when deploying the O4O Platform, particularly when using numeric passwords or when passwords are stored in GitHub Secrets.

## The Problem

PostgreSQL's Node.js driver (`pg`) requires the password parameter to be a string type. However, environment variables from GitHub Secrets or other sources may sometimes be interpreted as numbers if they contain only digits, leading to the error:

```
TypeError: password must be a string
```

## Root Causes

1. **Numeric Passwords**: Passwords that consist only of digits (e.g., "12345678") may be automatically converted to numbers by:
   - GitHub Actions when reading secrets
   - YAML parsers in deployment configurations
   - JavaScript's implicit type conversion

2. **Environment Variable Type Coercion**: Process environment variables are always strings in Node.js, but some deployment tools or configurations might pre-process them.

3. **PM2 Configuration**: PM2's ecosystem config files can inadvertently convert numeric strings to numbers when passing environment variables.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database Connection Configuration

In `apps/api-server/src/database/connection.ts`:

```typescript
// Always convert DB_PASSWORD to string
const DB_PASSWORD = String(process.env.DB_PASSWORD || '');
```

### 2. PM2 Ecosystem Configuration

In `deployment/pm2/ecosystem.config.js`:

```javascript
env: {
  // ... other env vars
  DB_PASSWORD: String(process.env.DB_PASSWORD || ''),
  // ... other env vars
}
```

### 3. Testing Scripts

Two testing scripts are available to diagnose password issues:

#### Basic Test (`npm run db:test`)
```bash
cd apps/api-server
npm run db:test
```

#### Detailed Test (`npm run db:test:detailed`)
```bash
cd apps/api-server
npm run db:test:detailed
```

The detailed test provides:
- Password type diagnostics
- Environment variable analysis
- Multiple connection test methods
- TypeORM compatibility check

## GitHub Actions Configuration

### Setting Secrets Correctly

When adding database passwords to GitHub Secrets:

**✅ Correct:**
```yaml
# In GitHub Secrets UI, always add as a string
DB_PASSWORD: "12345678"  # With quotes
```

**❌ Incorrect:**
```yaml
# This may cause issues
DB_PASSWORD: 12345678    # Without quotes
```

### Deployment Workflow

The deployment workflows have been updated to handle passwords safely:

```yaml
- name: Create production environment file
  run: |
    cat > .env.production << EOF
    # ... other variables
    DB_PASSWORD='${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}'  # Single quotes preserve string
    # ... other variables
    EOF
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always Use String Conversion**: When accessing `DB_PASSWORD`, always wrap it with `String()`:
   ```typescript
   const password = String(process.env.DB_PASSWORD || '');
   ```

2. **Avoid Numeric-Only Passwords**: While the code now handles them correctly, consider using alphanumeric passwords for better security.

3. **Test Before Deployment**: Use the provided test scripts to verify database connectivity before deploying.

4. **Quote Environment Variables**: In shell scripts and deployment configurations, always quote password variables:
   ```bash
   DB_PASSWORD="${DB_PASSWORD}"  # Good
   DB_PASSWORD=$DB_PASSWORD      # May cause issues
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "password must be a string"

1. Check the actual type of DB_PASSWORD:
   ```bash
   npm run db:test:detailed
   ```

2. Verify GitHub Secrets are set as strings (re-add with quotes if needed)

3. Check PM2 environment:
   ```bash
   pm2 env api-server | grep DB_PASSWORD
   ```

### Error: "password authentication failed"

This is different from the type error and indicates:
- Wrong password
- User doesn't exist
- Database doesn't exist
- Network connectivity issues

Use the test scripts to diagnose:
```bash
npm run db:test
```

## Summary

The "password must be a string" error has been resolved by:
1. Explicitly converting `DB_PASSWORD` to a string in all database configurations
2. Adding comprehensive test scripts for debugging
3. Updating deployment configurations to preserve string types
4. Documenting best practices for password handling

Always use `String(process.env.DB_PASSWORD || '')` when accessing the database password to ensure type safety.
