# O4O Platform Monorepo Dependency Resolution Analysis

## Investigation Summary

### Root Cause Analysis

The internal @o4o/* packages were failing to resolve in Vite applications despite external packages working correctly due to several configuration issues:

1. **Missing Vite Aliases**: The vite.config files in both admin-dashboard and main-site were missing proper alias configurations for @o4o/* packages
2. **Missing Package Dependencies**: auth-context package was missing @o4o/types in its dependencies
3. **Incomplete ESM Configuration**: Package.json files lacked proper "exports" field for ESM module resolution
4. **TypeScript Path Mapping Issues**: tsconfig files had inconsistent path mappings that didn't point to the /src directories

### Key Findings

#### Workspace Structure
- Workspace configuration in root package.json is correct: `["apps/*", "packages/*"]`
- All packages are properly symlinked in node_modules/@o4o/
- Package naming follows @o4o/* convention consistently
- Directory structure matches workspace configuration

#### Build Configuration Issues
1. **TypeScript Build**: All packages use `emitDeclarationOnly: true`, only generating .d.ts files
2. **Main/Types Fields**: Point to TypeScript source files (`./src/index.ts`) instead of compiled JavaScript
3. **Missing Exports Field**: No ESM exports configuration in package.json files

#### Dependency Chain
```
@o4o/types (no dependencies)
@o4o/utils (no @o4o dependencies)
@o4o/ui (no @o4o dependencies)
@o4o/auth-client (no @o4o dependencies)
@o4o/auth-context -> @o4o/auth-client, @o4o/types (was missing)
```

### Applied Fixes

1. **Updated vite.config.ts in admin-dashboard**:
   - Added aliases for all @o4o/* packages pointing to their /src directories
   - Added optimizeDeps.include for all @o4o packages

2. **Updated vite.config.ts in main-site**:
   - Standardized aliases to point to /src directories
   - Added missing @o4o/auth-client and @o4o/auth-context aliases
   - Added optimizeDeps.include for all @o4o packages

3. **Fixed missing dependency**:
   - Added @o4o/types to auth-context package.json dependencies

4. **Added ESM exports field** to all package.json files:
   ```json
   "exports": {
     ".": {
       "types": "./src/index.ts",
       "default": "./src/index.ts"
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Updated TypeScript paths** in tsconfig files to point to /src directories

### Why Internal Packages Failed While External Worked

External packages (66 total) worked because:
- They are published, compiled JavaScript packages in node_modules
- They have proper package.json exports/main fields
- Vite's dependency pre-bundling handles them automatically

Internal @o4o packages failed because:
- They point to TypeScript source files, not compiled JavaScript
- Vite couldn't resolve them without explicit aliases
- Missing exports field prevented proper ESM resolution
- TypeScript path mappings were inconsistent

### Verification

All packages now:
- Build successfully with `npm run build:packages`
- Have consistent TypeScript version (5.8.3)
- Have proper React 19.1.0 dependencies where needed
- Are properly aliased in Vite configurations
- Have ESM-compatible exports configuration

The monorepo structure is now properly configured for Vite to resolve internal TypeScript packages directly from source.
