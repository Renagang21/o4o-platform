# Auto-Recovery and Incident Response System Guide

## Overview

The Auto-Recovery and Incident Response System is a comprehensive intelligent system designed to automatically detect, respond to, and resolve issues before they impact users. It provides multiple layers of protection and recovery mechanisms to ensure maximum uptime and reliability.

## System Components

### 1. Auto Recovery Service (`AutoRecoveryService`)
**Primary orchestrator that coordinates all recovery activities.**

- **Monitors**: Active alerts and system health
- **Responds**: Automatically executes recovery actions based on predefined rules
- **Escalates**: Issues to manual intervention when automated recovery fails
- **Tracks**: All recovery attempts and success rates

**Key Features:**
- Configurable recovery actions with safety checks
- Automatic rollback on recovery failure
- Cooldown periods to prevent recovery loops
- Comprehensive logging and metrics

### 2. Circuit Breaker Service (`CircuitBreakerService`)
**Prevents cascade failures by monitoring service health and failing fast.**

- **Open State**: Blocks requests to failing services
- **Half-Open State**: Tests service recovery
- **Closed State**: Normal operation
- **Monitoring**: Response times, error rates, and failure counts

**Circuit Breakers Created:**
- Database connections
- External API calls
- Internal service communications
- Cache operations
- File storage operations

### 3. Graceful Degradation Service (`GracefulDegradationService`)
**Maintains partial functionality during outages.**

**Degradation Levels:**
- **Minimal**: Reduce non-essential features
- **Moderate**: Simplified UI and caching
- **Severe**: Static content and essential functions only
- **Emergency**: Basic functionality only

**Degradation Actions:**
- Disable features
- Switch to cached content
- Reduce functionality
- Enable rate limiting

- **L4**: Management (60 min timeout)
- **L5**: Executive (90 min timeout)

**Notification Channels:**
- Email notifications
- SMS alerts
- Slack messages
- Phone calls (for critical incidents)

### 5. Self-Healing Service (`SelfHealingService`)
**Performs automated system maintenance and healing.**

**Healing Actions:**
- Service restarts
- Cache clearing
- Memory cleanup
- Connection resets
- Resource scaling
- Log cleanup

**Health Monitoring:**
- Memory usage tracking
- CPU utilization monitoring
- Disk space checking
- Service status validation
- Performance metrics

### 6. Deployment Monitoring Service (`DeploymentMonitoringService`)
**Monitors deployments and performs automatic rollbacks.**

**Features:**

   - Reset database connections
   - Scale resources if possible

3. **Database Connection Recovery**

### Custom Recovery Actions

You can define custom recovery actions by adding them to the `AutoRecoveryService`:

```typescript
const customAction: RecoveryAction = {
  id: 'custom-memory-cleanup',
  name: 'Custom Memory Cleanup',
  description: 'Custom memory cleanup for specific scenarios',
  severity: AlertSeverity.HIGH,
  conditions: {
    metricThresholds: { memory_usage: 90 },
    duration: 5
  },
  actions: {
    immediate: [
      {
        type: 'execute_script',
        target: '/scripts/custom-cleanup.sh',
        parameters: { aggressive: true }
      }
    ]
  },
  maxRetries: 2,
  cooldownPeriod: 10,
  autoExecute: true
};

await autoRecoveryService.addRecoveryAction(customAction);
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics Tracked

1. **Recovery Success Rate**: Percentage of successful automatic recoveries
2. **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: Average time to resolve issues
3. **Circuit Breaker States**: Number of open/closed circuits
4. **Degradation Events**: Frequency and duration of degradations
5. **Escalation Rates**: How often incidents require manual intervention
6. **System Health Scores**: Overall system health indicators

### Dashboards and Alerts

- **Recovery Dashboard**: Real-time view of all recovery activities
- **System Health Dashboard**: Current system health and metrics
- **Incident Timeline**: Historical view of incidents and resolutions
- **Performance Impact**: Before/after comparison of recovery actions

## Best Practices

### 1. Recovery Action Design
- **Keep actions simple**: Each action should do one thing well
- **Include safety checks**: Always validate before and after actions
- **Plan rollbacks**: Every action should have a rollback plan
- **Test regularly**: Use the test endpoints to validate actions

### 2. Escalation Rules
- **Set appropriate timeouts**: Balance quick response with stability
- **Define clear ownership**: Each level should have clear responsibilities
- **Test notification channels**: Ensure all channels work reliably
- **Update on-call schedules**: Keep contact information current

### 3. Monitoring Configuration
- **Set realistic thresholds**: Avoid false positives and negatives
- **Monitor trends**: Look for patterns in failures and recoveries
- **Regular review**: Periodically review and adjust configurations
- **Document changes**: Keep track of configuration changes

### 4. Incident Response
- **Acknowledge quickly**: Acknowledge incidents to stop escalation
- **Document resolutions**: Record what worked for future reference
- **Post-incident review**: Analyze incidents to improve the system
- **Update procedures**: Continuously improve response procedures

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **Role-based access**: Different roles have different access levels
- **Admin functions**: Critical functions require admin privileges
- **Audit logging**: All actions are logged for security auditing
- **API authentication**: All endpoints require proper authentication

### Safety Mechanisms
- **Cooldown periods**: Prevent rapid-fire recovery attempts
- **Concurrent limits**: Limit number of simultaneous recovery actions
- **Safety checks**: Validate system state before taking actions
- **Rollback capabilities**: Always provide way to undo changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Recovery actions not triggering**
   - Check if auto-recovery is enabled
   - Verify alert conditions are met
   - Review cooldown periods
   - Check system logs for errors

2. **Circuit breakers stuck open**
   - Verify underlying service health
   - Check circuit breaker configuration
   - Manually reset if needed
   - Review failure thresholds

3. **Escalations not working**
   - Verify notification configurations
   - Check on-call schedules
   - Test notification channels
   - Review escalation rules

4. **Deployments not rolling back**
   - Check auto-rollback configuration
   - Verify health check endpoints
   - Review deployment validation rules
   - Check rollback permissions

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check system overview
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/api/auto-recovery/overview

# Check recovery history
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/api/auto-recovery/history?limit=10

# Check system health
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/api/auto-recovery/self-healing/health

# Test recovery action
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auto-recovery/test/memory-cleanup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"alertId": "test-alert-id"}'
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Monitoring Integration
- Integrates with existing `OperationsMonitoringService`
- Uses existing alert system for triggering

- **Slack/Teams**: Incident notifications
- **Email systems**: Alert notifications
- **SMS providers**: Critical alert notifications
- **External monitoring**: Datadog, New Relic, etc.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning**: Predictive failure detection
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Pattern recognition in failures
3. **Integration APIs**: Better third-party integrations
4. **Mobile Apps**: Mobile incident management
5. **Advanced Rollbacks**: Database schema rollbacks
6. **Multi-region**: Cross-region failover capabilities
