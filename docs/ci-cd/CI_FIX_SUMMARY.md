# CI/CD Pipeline Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The CI/CD pipeline was failing with TypeScript errors because:
1. The shared packages (@o4o/types, @o4o/utils, etc.) were not being built before running type-check
2. The cache was only storing node_modules but not the built package dist directories
3. When CI restored from cache, it had dependencies but no built packages

## Root Cause
- TypeScript couldn't find modules like `@o4o/types` because they reference `file:../../packages/types` in package.json
- These file references require the packages to be built (have dist directories) before TypeScript can resolve them
- The CI was running `npm run type-check` directly without first building the packages

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed CI Workflow Cache Configuration
- Updated cache paths to include package dist directories:
  ```yaml
  path: |
    node_modules
    apps/*/node_modules
    packages/*/node_modules
    packages/*/dist  # Added this
  ```
- Updated cache key to invalidate when package source changes:
  ```yaml
  key: deps-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}-${{ hashFiles('packages/*/src/**') }}
  ```

### 2. Added Package Build Step
- Added a step to build packages if not cached in all jobs that need them:
  ```yaml
  - name: Build packages if not cached
    run: |
      if [ ! -d "packages/types/dist" ]; then
        echo "Building packages..."
        npm run build:packages
      else
        echo "Packages already built (from cache)"
      fi
  ```

### 3. Updated All Affected Workflows
- Fixed in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
  - setup job: Updated cache configuration
  - type-check job: Added package build step
  - lint job: Added package build step
  - test-unit job: Added package build step
  - build job: Always builds packages fresh
  - test-e2e job: Added package build step

- Fixed in `.github/workflows/deploy-api-server.yml`:
  - Added package build step before type-check

- Fixed in `.github/workflows/deploy-main-site.yml`:
  - Added package build step in both check jobs

- Fixed in `.github/workflows/deploy-admin-dashboard.yml`:
  - Added package build step before type-check

## Verification
To verify the fix works correctly:
1. Clean install simulates CI environment
2. Type-check fails without built packages (expected)
3. After building packages, type-check succeeds

Run: `./scripts/test-ci-build.sh` to verify locally

## Impact
- CI/CD pipelines will now properly build shared packages before type checking
- Caching is more efficient - built packages are cached
- No changes needed to application code or configurations
- All workflows now follow the same pattern for consistency
