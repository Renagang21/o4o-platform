# CI/CD Failure Investigation Report

## Executive Summary
Multiple CI/CD failures have been identified stemming from **package-lock.json desynchronization** after adding the `serve@14.2.4` dependency to the admin-dashboard. GitHub Actions permission errors appear to be secondary symptoms of failed builds rather than root causes.

## Problem Analysis

### 1. Primary Issue: npm ci Failure (Root Cause)
**Status**: CRITICAL - Blocking all CI/CD pipelines
**Impact**: All workflows fail at dependency installation stage

**Evidence**:
```
npm error Missing: serve@14.2.4 from lock file
npm error Missing: @zeit/schemas@2.36.0 from lock file
npm error Missing: ajv@8.12.0 from lock file
... (20+ missing dependencies)
```

**Root Cause**: 
- `serve@14.2.4` was added to `apps/admin-dashboard/package.json` as a devDependency
- `package-lock.json` was not updated to include serve and its dependency tree
- `npm ci` requires exact lock file synchronization and fails when packages are missing

**Timeline**:
- Recent commits show deployment workflow changes (npm ci → npm install)
- This suggests the issue has been ongoing and workarounds were attempted

### 2. GitHub Actions Permission Errors (Secondary)
**Status**: CONSEQUENTIAL - Result of failed builds
**Impact**: Failed label creation, issue comments, and git operations

**Analysis**:
- Workflows have proper permissions defined:
  - `pr-checks.yml`: Has `contents: read` and `pull-requests: write`
  - `codeql.yml`: Has required security permissions
- Permission errors likely occur when workflows fail and attempt cleanup/reporting
- These are symptoms, not causes

### 3. Environment Differences
**Local vs CI/CD**:
- Local: `npm install` works (creates/updates lock file automatically)
- CI/CD: `npm ci` fails (requires exact lock file match)
- Deployment: Already changed from `npm ci` to `npm install` as workaround

## Problem Correlation Analysis

### Dependencies Between Issues:
```
serve package added to package.json
    ↓
package-lock.json not updated
    ↓
npm ci fails in CI/CD
    ↓
Build jobs fail
    ↓
Cleanup/reporting steps fail with permission errors
```

### Independent vs Correlated:
- **Root Issue**: package-lock.json desynchronization (independent)
- **Build Failures**: Direct result of root issue (dependent)
- **Permission Errors**: Side effects of build failures (dependent)

## Immediate Fixes Required

### Fix 1: Synchronize package-lock.json
```bash
# From project root
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
rm -rf apps/*/node_modules packages/*/node_modules
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "fix: synchronize package-lock.json with serve dependency"
git push
```

### Fix 2: Verify Local Build
```bash
# Test that CI will work
npm ci  # This should now work
npm run build:packages
npm run build
```

## Configuration Changes Needed

### 1. Prevent Future Desynchronization
Add pre-commit hook to ensure package-lock.json is always updated:
```json
// package.json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "npm ls && git add package-lock.json"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. CI/CD Workflow Improvements
Add lock file validation step early in CI:
```yaml
- name: Validate lock file
  run: |
    npm ci --dry-run || (echo "Lock file out of sync. Run 'npm install' locally and commit package-lock.json" && exit 1)
```

### 3. Better Error Reporting
Add explicit error handling for common issues:
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    npm ci || {
      echo "::error::npm ci failed. This usually means package-lock.json is out of sync."
      echo "::error::Run 'npm install' locally and commit the updated package-lock.json"
      exit 1
    }
```

## Step-by-Step Resolution Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix (5 minutes)
1. Run `npm install` from project root
2. Verify `package-lock.json` includes serve dependencies
3. Commit and push updated lock file
4. Monitor CI/CD pipeline for successful builds

### Phase 2: Verification (10 minutes)
1. Check all workflow runs complete successfully
2. Verify no permission errors in logs
3. Confirm deployments work properly
4. Test PR creation and labeling

### Phase 3: Prevention (15 minutes)
1. Add pre-commit hooks for lock file validation
2. Update CI workflows with better error messages
3. Document the npm ci vs npm install distinction
4. Add lock file check to PR template

### Phase 4: Long-term Improvements (optional)
1. Consider using `npm ci` in development to catch issues early
2. Add automated lock file updates via Dependabot
3. Implement branch protection rules requiring CI passage
4. Add monitoring for dependency drift

## Key Learnings

1. **Always update package-lock.json** when adding dependencies
2. **npm ci is strict** - it's designed to catch drift in CI/CD
3. **Permission errors can be red herrings** - check earlier failures first
4. **Deployment workarounds** (npm install) mask the real issue
5. **Local success doesn't guarantee CI success** due to lock file requirements

## Recommended Actions

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Update package-lock.json and push
2. **TODAY**: Add validation steps to CI workflows
3. **THIS WEEK**: Implement pre-commit hooks
4. **ONGOING**: Monitor for similar issues and educate team

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All CI/CD pipelines passing
- [ ] No npm ci errors
- [ ] No permission errors in workflows
- [ ] Deployments using npm ci (not npm install)
- [ ] Lock file stays synchronized
