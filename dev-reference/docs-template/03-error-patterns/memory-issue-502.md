# Memory Issue - 502 Error Pattern

## Error Description
This document describes a common error pattern where the application returns a 502 Bad Gateway error due to memory consumption issues.

## Symptoms
- HTTP 502 errors during high traffic periods
- Server logs show "JavaScript heap out of memory" errors
- API response times gradually increase before the error
- Process automatically restarts after crashing

## Causes
1. **Memory Leaks**: Improper resource management leading to gradual memory accumulation
2. **Insufficient Resources**: Container/VM has insufficient memory allocation
3. **Large Request Payloads**: Processing extremely large JSON payloads without streaming
4. **Inefficient Caching**: Storing too much data in memory caches
5. **Database Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Too many open connections to the database

## Diagnostic Steps
1. Check application logs for "JavaScript heap out of memory" errors
2. Monitor memory usage with `node --inspect` and Chrome DevTools
3. Use diagnostic tools like `node-memwatch` or `node-heapdump` to identify memory leaks
4. Review recent code changes that might have introduced memory issues
5. Check the size of request/response payloads during failure periods

## Resolution
1. **Increase Memory Allocation**: Temporary solution to allow the service to continue operating
   ```
   # In pm2.config.js
   max_memory_restart: '2G'  // Increase from default 1G
   ```

2. **Fix Memory Leaks**:
   - Close resources properly (database connections, file handles)
   - Use weak references where appropriate
   - Implement proper cleanup of event listeners
   - Use streaming for large data operations

3. **Implement Circuit Breakers**: 
   ```javascript
   const circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker({
     failureThreshold: 3,
     resetTimeout: 30000
   });
   ```

4. **Optimize Database Queries**:
   - Add proper indexes
   - Limit result sets
   - Use pagination

## Prevention
1. Set up memory usage monitoring and alerting
2. Implement load testing as part of CI/CD pipeline
3. Use automated memory leak detection tools
4. Conduct regular code reviews focused on resource management
5. Use containerization with proper resource limits
