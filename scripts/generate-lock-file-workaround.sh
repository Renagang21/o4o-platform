# Workaround for Firebase Studio npm bug to generate package-lock.json

echo "========================================"
echo ""
echo "Due to Firebase Studio npm bug, package-lock.json cannot be generated locally."
echo ""
echo "SOLUTIONS:"
echo ""
echo "1. âœ… RECOMMENDED: Use GitHub Actions"
echo "   - The workflow is already configured and ready"
echo "   - Go to: https://github.com/[your-repo]/actions/workflows/generate-package-lock.yml"
echo "   - Click 'Run workflow' â†’ Select branch â†’ Run"
echo ""
echo "2. Alternative: Use Docker"
echo "   docker run --rm -v \$(pwd):/app -w /app node:22.18.0-alpine npm install --package-lock-only"
echo ""
echo "3. Alternative: Use GitHub Codespaces"
echo "   - Create a new Codespace from your repo"
echo "   - Run: npm install"
echo "   - Commit the generated package-lock.json"
echo ""
echo "4. Temporary Fix: Restore from previous commit (Node.js 20 version)"
echo "   git show d34ff3b3^:package-lock.json > package-lock.json"
echo "   # Note: This will need to be regenerated with Node.js 22"
echo ""
echo "IMPORTANT: The cache-dependency-path fix is a temporary workaround."
echo "Once package-lock.json is generated, workflows will use proper caching."
