üìã Summary:
- Added timeout options to rsync commands
- Created backups of all workflows
- Some workflows may need manual updates for full retry logic

Next steps:
1. Review the changes
2. Test with debug-ssh.yml workflow
3. Update GitHub secrets if needed:
   - WEB_HOST
   - WEB_USER  
   - WEB_SSH_KEY
   - WEB_HOST_IP (optional)
   - WEB_SSH_PORT (optional, if not 22)
